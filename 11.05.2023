2nd day of decline in learning path. However, I somewhat managed to achieve what I had planned for the today. 
Easily, getting influenced by social media content. Feeling low on motivation to do much. But better than yesterday. 
Learnt about Artificial Inteligence a bit. Read about it on news. Geoffery Hinton quit Google after a long tenure at the company. He is considered as the 'Godfather of AI'.
In an interview, he mentioned the threat of AI in the near future, the increase in its intelligence via self learning, etc. I browsed on humane.ai and stable diffusion.

I am myself working on LLMs, and I can say that it is upgrading itself. In the coming future, AI would replace many blue collar jobs including mine. I got a bit worried about my career today.
I have to keep upgrading myself and learn everyday. However, I want to device a learning curve for myself. 
Feeling too much anxiety. Gotta deal with it.
Its okay.

See you tom.
