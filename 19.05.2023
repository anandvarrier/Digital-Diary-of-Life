Couldn't write anything nor study for 3 days.
Nothing much to write. It's the most late I have ever sat in the office. I have body pains because of excessive sitting.
I feel like hunting, getting ragda, cream rolling, running 100s of km, camping, and much more.
I feel I am moving away from materilistic world. I want to delve more into spirituality.
I will be going to therapy again tom. I feel I should do this for my own good and for my loved once. 
I know who I am and to whom I am attracted to. But I beleive that a 3rd person would give me more clarity.
Because of such thoughts which is basically anxiety, I feel like going towards spirituality. 
I am trusting on my therapist. 

Hope I become a better human. 

See you tom.
