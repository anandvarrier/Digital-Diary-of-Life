Went to therapy 2 days back. Even though thing are complicated rn, it will be in control.
My doctor said the thoughts that comes to me is mainly because of stress. Everyone has different ways of showing stress or in other words, everyone has different
ways how they react when they have stress in life. Towards, evening today I again strated to have those thoughts and  realized it just now that it is because of work stress.
I have been lagging behind in my work as compared to my peers. The work that I am doing is basically data entry work. It does not interest me but anyways doing it. 
I am listening to songs and trying to reduce the boredom of the work. Howevver, it feels like my speed gets reduced. DOn't know if this is true.

Anyways, my doc told me few things to cope up with these thoughts i.r to run. 
I resumed running today.

Anyways, I will stop my work. I will resume it tom. I have some more work left but if I sit longer, my stress will increase. 
I have started feeling bloated due to gas formation. My chest pains sometimes. I am being forgetful a lot.

I will write tom.
