Hi there,
Its been 2 weeks I have been documnented anything about my life. 
My brother came from UK, family was in Kerala. Spent a good time with everyone.

Got derailed from my routine. 

I have observed that I get too attached with things-mobile, movies, social media,etc
I take too much time to just get back to a normal routine. 

I realise things and now I am gonna act on what I have learnt. 
I am doing that and I am back on track. I am sticking to my routine.

Sleeping on time-waking up early-mental training-physical training-work and learn-family time-building my knowledge 
Things are happein the way I want. I am working towards figuring out what I want in life. 

Signing off.
