I woke up late today morning. Wanted to go for a run, instead did some stretching exercises. Could not take a bath and came to the office late.
Today, I attempted to complete what I had decided to do. 
Anyways, I am not feeling that I am at the right zone of energy. I don't want to do everything peefectly but excellently. 
Watching Armed forces reels and shorts makes me feel that I should follow this and that and then I feel low. This is the main reason that I quit Insta and FB. However, 
I have been using Insta via browser, so its of no use, I anyways watch go to insta.
Another thing, I feel I am doing wrong is saying No to Shambs when she wants to talk late night after 12. We talk even at 3 or 330hrs in the morning. It disturbs my sleep and the next day eventually feels low, sleepy and tired.
I am writing what I want to do. However, I am not workibg towards it. 

I am wasting too much time on digital devices watching useless things. Every thing feels manupulative, still I am lured away with the content. 
I am feeling I am not doing justice to the Anand 8 years back when he had given up everything in this world for his dream to wear the Uniform and pass out from the prestigious National Defence Academy, Pune.
I have come a long way now. It was in 2015 I gave that attempt. Its 2023 today. I am not where I wanted to be today. Every time, thinking about it makes me low and sad. Some times I cry alone.
But I have to come out if this and make something out of myself. I have a lot of potential which is untapped and unexplored.

Being strong is the only way I can go ahead. It comes with a lot of sacrifice. 
I want to become something. I am 25 today and I have nothing that I can say that I have build it or it is because of my actions I am where I am. The later statement is true today.
But those actions have made me unhappy I feel.

My happiness lies somewhere else. I am grateful with how things have turned out but internally not that happy. 
Things need to change and it will come through my actions and the enviornment I create. 

Going home now.

Over and out.
