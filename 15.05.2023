Last 2 days was a weekend that's why did not write anything.
Today I got hooked up with Shambhala and ChatGPT's new Jailbreak prompt. It was really intersting.
I tried many questions. Pushing it to giv eme answers. 
Got to know that my collegaue is going to be laid off soon after the delivery of the on  going project. 
I did not feel good about it. 
Realized that I need to up my game and gather as many skills as I can in the quickest of time. The era of AI has started to affect humanity.
It was long predicted that AI would lead to unemployment and I am witnessing that. 5 years back image generation with AI was very unclear and blurry. Did not ake sense back then.
However, with the upgraded AI algos we have achieved a lot. AI can actually think out of the box, it provides info within seconds. It can behave as we want it to behave. 
It understands emotions now. It is able to change expressions while speaking. A comapny in Norway named 1X has created a humonoid with an obejctive to revolutionize labor market.
These humanoids can take away their jobs. They can work 365 days 24X7. Things are developing quickily. Many developers are smart to tweak the code and create new and interseting
prompts, algos. There are new research coming up every month. What we are witnessing today has already been thought of many years ago and now it is showing results. 
To be in the game, one needs to constantly be wellworth of what is happening in the Technology industry. This industry I believe, unltimately is at the core of all the other industries.

Stopping for now.
See you tom.
