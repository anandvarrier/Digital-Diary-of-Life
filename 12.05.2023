Yesterday night and today morning I fell in the hands of Lust. 
Did not control myself. Wasted a lot of time and mental energy. Made myself feel guilty. However, I managed to come to office on time.
Had to skip my workout in the morning. Took an appointment with a therapist. 
My day went productive at office. I did the tasks that I had planned.
I learnt to connect my mouse and keyboard with 2 screens. Completed few tasks as well. 
Learnt a bit about Cloudera and its commands wrt to Sqoop.
Currently, feeling neutral. Maybe overthinking. 

Anyways, I will meet you later.

See you soon.
